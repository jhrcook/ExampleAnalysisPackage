This is an R package that was built by the commands in my book [*Package as Analysis*](https://jhrcook.github.io/package-as-analysis/). It exists merely as simple demonstration of a barebones package. In the future, I may add information here, but for now, especially while the book is under development, this will primarily remain empty.
